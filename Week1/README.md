Suggested Elements:
- `<details>` & `<summary>`
- `<figure>` & `<figcaption>`

- `<progress>`
- `<meter>`

Elements:

* `<dt>` & `<dd>`
>"description term" & "description detail"
>I use it to make a pseudo bullet point lists with my different portfolio elements

* `<aside>`
>"aside"
>This was used in conjunction with CSS styling to put text to the right of the main body of a detail

* `<bdo>`
>"bidirectional text"
> Made into a cool text reversing effect, though that is not its main use case of displaying non- left-to-right language text

* `<code>`

* `<d>`
>"date"
>Was used to reference a date while not specifically typing that date in the text.
