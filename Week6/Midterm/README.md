1. Project Description
This is an interactive portfolio for myself that displays projects I add manually and an automatically updating most recent project. Its meant to showcase my projects and my development skills to people I send it to (potential employers) and anyone who manages to find it.

2. Target Audience
Hiring managers at tech companies who are interested enough in my resume and cover letter to look at my portfolio and are looking for demonstrations of my practical projects and programming experience in a unique and eye-catching package.

3. Main Features
* Must have:
  * HTML Canvas display
  * Most recent game data
* Should have:
  * Parsed data for most recent game
  * Multiple sources for most recent game (I post on 2 different itch.io accounts)

  * Logo image for most recent game
* Won't have:
  * Dynamically placed projects and posts in interactive portfolio

4. Technologies Used

5. File Structure
* index.html
  * Website page
* css/style.css
  * Stylesheet

6. Challenges Faced

7. AI Tools Used
- None: Have not used any AI tools yet

8. Future Improvements
- Dynamically placed icons of projects corresponding to how long ago they were made
