### AI Disclosure & Outside Assets
Google Gemini was used to sanity check code and debug after extensive searching, but not to generate features wholesale.
Things AI helped me figure out:
 * Silly mistakes (id vs class)
 * Absolute positioning vs relative positioning (I think I still don't understand how to properly use it)
 * Why my SVG object wasn't scaled correctly
 * Debugging a lot more than I'd imagined near the deadline

I did use custom line detection code for collision:

#### Tips (mostly for myself)
* ctrl + / to comment things in or out
* "!" to put in the boilerplate code
* put the script element at the bottom of the page
* class is ".", id is "#"
