### AI Disclosure
Used bolt.new and Claude to help draft up a first draft, and used Cursor to fix/remember the fixes to the silly mistakes I made.
The one I used AI to help create (copying code directly from the AI) is in the Assignment5/WithAI folder.
I'll do a version that only uses the AI version as a reference, (not copying code) in the Assignment5/NoAI folder.

#### Tips (mostly for myself)
* ctrl + / to comment things in or out
* "!" to put in the boilerplate code
* put the script element at the bottom of the page
