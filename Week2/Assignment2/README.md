### Flexbox/Grid Implementation:
 * Sections
    * Header
    Used flexbox to make a nav bar for this.

    * About & Footer
    Combined these two sections, and put the image with alt text here, and the copywrite information.

    * Projects
    Included sections for each of the creeds I have worked in & used grid to create navigation for it.

#### Tips (mostly for myself)
